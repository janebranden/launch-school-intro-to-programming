What will the following programs return? What is value of arr after each?

1. arr = ["b", "a"]
   arr = arr.product(Array(1..3))
   arr.first.delete(arr.first.last)
2. arr = ["b", "a"]
   arr = arr.product([Array(1..3)])
   arr.first.delete(arr.first.last)

---------------------------------------

1. 1

resulting array from .product is [["b", 1], ["b", 2], ["b", 3], ["a", 1], ["a", 2], ["a", 3]]

.delete will remove all instances of specified value

arr.first.delete(arr.first.last) means
delete from the first pair, the last element of the first pair which is a 1
it doesn't delete every instance of 1 from the entire array because you're telling it to look at only the first pair
what is returned is what got deleted, i.e. 1

2. [1, 2, 3]

resulting array from .product is [["b", [1, 2, 3]], ["a", [1, 2, 3]]]

arr.first.delete(arr.first.last) means delete the last element from the first pair which is ["b", [1, 2, 3]]
the last element from the first pair is [1, 2, 3]
what is returned is what got deleted, i.e. [1, 2, 3]


** One of the big takeaways from this is what gets returned - delete does not return a modified array or a copy of the array;
   it returns what got deleted
