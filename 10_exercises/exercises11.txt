# Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.

--------------------------------

My answer:

I like Ruby-Doc.org because it's well-organized, thorough, has good/relevant examples,
  and isn't overly wordy.  Also I feel like it's the definitive word on the subject since
  it's from the source.

It's the source I've ended up using about 95% of the time when I've needed to look something
  up.  Even if I look at something else initially, I always end up going back to it.
