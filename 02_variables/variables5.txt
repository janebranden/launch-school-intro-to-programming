Look at the following programs...

x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x
and...

y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x

What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?

--------------

My answer: 

The first one prints a 3.  The second one produces an error because x is not defined outside.
