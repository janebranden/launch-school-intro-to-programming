Look at the following programs...

x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x
and...

y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x

What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?

--------------

book solution:

The first prints 3 to the screen. The second throws an error undefined local variable or method because x is not available as it is created within the scope of the do/end block.
