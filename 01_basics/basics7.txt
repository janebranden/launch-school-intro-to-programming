What does the following error message tell you?

SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

My answer:

There's an opening bracket with no closing bracket, or ...
you you used the wrong type of closing bracket
